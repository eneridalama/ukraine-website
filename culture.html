                <h3>THE CULTURE OF UKRAINE</h3>
                <p>Ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by Orthodox Christianity, the dominant religion in the
                    country.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="grid__container">

                    <h3>Literature</h2>
                        <p id="big-p"> Technically the history of Ukrainian literature dates all of the way back to the
                            11th century, however these earliest writings were liturgical and were written in the Old
                            Church Slavonic language, not in true Ukrainian. Historical accounts of the time were
                            referred to as chronicles, the most significant of which was the Primary Chronicle. </p>

                <div class="grid">
                    <h3>Architecture</h2>
                        <p id="big-p"> Ukrainian architecture includes the motifs and styles that are found in
                            structures built in modern Ukraine, and by Ukrainians worldwide. These include initial roots
                            which were established in the Eastern Slavic state of Kievan Rus'. Since the
                            Christianization of Kievan Rus' for several ages Ukrainian architecture was influenced by
                            the Byzantine architecture.</p>

                <div class="grid">
                    <h3>Weaving and embroidery</h2>
                        <p > Artisan textile arts play an important role in Ukrainian culture, especially in
                            Ukrainian wedding traditions. Ukrainian embroidery is used in traditional folk dress and in
                            traditional celebrations. Ukrainian embroidery varies depending on the region of origin and
                            the designs have a long history of motifs. National dress is woven and highly decorated.

                        <p> Music is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many
                            influences. From traditional folk music, to classical and modern rock, Ukraine has produced
                            several internationally recognised musicians including Kirill Karabits, Okean Elzy and
                            Ruslana.</p>

                    <h3>Sport</h2>
                        <p id="big-p"> Ukraine greatly benefited from the Soviet emphasis on physical education. These
                            policies left Ukraine with hundreds of stadia, swimming pools, gymnasia and many other
                            athletic facilities. The most popular sport is football. The top professional league is the
                            Vyscha Liha.</p>
