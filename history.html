                <h2>The History of Ukraine</h2>
                <p> Ukraine is a unitary multiparty republic with one legislative body; its head of state is
                    the president, and the head of government is the prime minister.
                    Different parts of the area that is today Ukraine were invaded and occupied in the 1st millennium
                    BCE by the Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians and in the 1st millennium CE by the Goths, Huns,
                    Bulgars, Avars, Khazars, and Magyars (Hungarians).
                    Slavic tribes settled there after the 4th century. Kyiv was the chief town. <br> <br>
                    The Mongol conquest in the mid-13th century decisively ended Kyivan power.
                    From the 14th to the 18th century, portions of Ukraine were ruled by Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.
                    In addition, Cossacks controlled a largely self-governing territory known as the Hetmanate.
                    Most of Ukraine fell to Russian rule in the 18th century.
                    In the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917, most of the Ukrainian region
                    became a republic of the Soviet Union, though parts of western Ukraine were divided between Poland,
                    Romania, and Czechoslovakia.
                    Ukraine suffered a severe famine, called the Holodomor, in 1932–33 under Soviet leader Joseph
                    Stalin.
                    Overrun by Axis armies in 1941 during World War II, Ukraine was further devastated before being
                    retaken by the Soviets in 1944. <br><br>
                    By the end of the war, the borders of the Ukrainian S.S.R. had been redrawn to include the western
                    Ukrainian territories.
                    Ukraine was the site of the 1986 Chernobyl accident at a Soviet-built nuclear power plant.
                    In 1991 Ukraine declared independence.
                    The turmoil it experienced in the 1990s as it attempted to implement economic and political reforms
                    culminated in the disputed presidential election of 2004;
                    mass protests over the results came to be known as the Orange Revolution.
                    The effects of the revolution were short-lived, however, and the country remained divided along
                    regional and ethnic lines.
                    Another mass protest movement—this one centred on Kyiv’s Maidan (Independence Square)—toppled the
                    government in 2014. <br><br>
                    As the interim government struggled to resolve the country’s dire economic situation, Russian troops
                    occupied the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea.
                    Shortly thereafter, in March 2014, Crimea declared independence from Ukraine and was annexed by
                    Russia.
                    Fighting between pro-Russian separatist militias and Ukrainian government forces remained ongoing in
                    eastern Ukraine.
                    In late 2021 Russia began a military buildup along its border with Ukraine, and in February 2022
                    Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>
